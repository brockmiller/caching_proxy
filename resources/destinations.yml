# YAML Config file for use with CachingProxy::MultipleDestinationResolver
#
# Config is a map of the destination alias to its host address and port
# e.g.  authService-v1:
#         host: http://auth-service.example.com/v1
#         port: 80
#
# The colon ':' prefix ensures that keys are loaded as symbols rather than
# strings.
